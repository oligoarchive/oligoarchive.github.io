# Problem

The demand for data-driven decision making coupled with need to retain data to meet regulatory compliance requirements has resulted
in a rapid increase in the amount of archival data stored by enterprises. As data generation rate far outpaces the rate of improvement
in storage density of media like HDD and tape, researchers have started investigating new architectures and media types that can store such “cold”, infrequently accessed data at very low cost.

# Synthetic DNA
Synthetic DNA is one such storage media that has received some attention recently due to its high density and durability. DNA possesses three key properties that make it relevant for archival storage. First, it is an extremely dense threedimensional storage medium that has the theoretical ability to store 455 Exabytes in 1 gram; in contrast, a 3.5” HDD can store 10TB and weighs 600 grams today. Second, DNA can last several centuries even in harsh storage environments; HDD and tape have life times of five and thirty years. Third, it is very easy, quick, and cheap to perform in-vitro replication of DNA; tape and HDD have bandwidth limitations that result in hours or days for copying large EB-sized archives.

# Research
In this project, we investigate the problem of integrating DNA in the enterprise storage hierarchy.
